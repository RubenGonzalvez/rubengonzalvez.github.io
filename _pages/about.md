I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Complutense University of Madrid, where I also work as a Teaching Assistant. I am a member of the research group Economic Analysis, Design and Evaluation of Public Policies from [UCM](https://www.ucm.es/grupos/grupo/1011) and I also collaborate with the research group on Labor And Structural Transformations in Spain and the European Union [LAST](https://www.ucm.es/last).


My research focuses on applied macroeconomics, labor economics, and applied microeconometrics. As part of my PhD thesis I am analyzing the impact of the 2019 minimum wage hike on Spanish firms, focusing on firm-level responses to labor cost changes. Another part of my thesis examines debt and investment cycles in non-financial corporations and its heterogeneous behaviour during the business cycles.
